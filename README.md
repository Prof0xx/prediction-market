**Rapid prediction markets on Base blockchain for short-duration crypto events**

> Built with the new BUILD_KIT workflow — designed for Cursor AI Agent mode.

## 🚀 What is this?

A decentralized prediction market platform for betting on short-duration crypto events:
- **Asset price movements** (BTC/ETH up/down in next 10 minutes)
- **Esports outcomes** (next kill, round winner)
- **Social events** (tweet viral metrics, trending topics)  
- **Meme coin narratives** (pump/dump predictions)

Built on **Base blockchain** for speed and low fees.

## ⚡ Quick Start with Cursor

This repo uses the **BUILD_KIT** workflow for seamless AI-powered development:

### 1. Clone & Open
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Prof0xx/prediction-market.git
cd prediction-market
```

### 2. Open in Cursor
- Open this folder in **Cursor**
- Switch to **Agent mode** (Ctrl+L)

### 3. Start Building
Type one of these commands in Cursor Agent:
- `go` 
- `start`
- `begin`

**That's it!** Cursor will automatically:
1. Read `AGENTS.md` to understand its role
2. Work through `docs/TASKS.md` task-by-task
3. Run verification commands for each task
4. Check off completed tasks and continue
5. Build the entire application from scratch

## 📚 How it Works
